    <h1>What is Data?</h1>
    <hr>
    <p><strong>Big Data</strong> is a collection of data that is huge in volume, yet growing exponentially with time. It is a data with so large size and complexity that none of traditional data management tools can store it or process it efficiently. Big data is also a data but with huge size.</p>
    <h1>Examples Of Big Data</h1>
    <p>Following are some of the Big Data examples-</p>
    <p>The <strong>New York Stock Exchange</strong> generates about one <strong>terabyte</strong> of new trade data per day.</p>

    <h1>Social Media</h1>
    <p>The statistic shows that <strong>500+terabytes</strong> of new data get ingested into the databases of social media site <strong>Facebook</strong>, every day. This data is mainly generated in terms of photo and video uploads, message exchanges, putting comments etc.</p>
    <img width="40%" style="margin-left: 30%;" src="061114_0759_WhatIsBigDa3.jpg" alt="">
    <p>A single <strong>Jet engine</strong> can generate <strong>10+terabytes</strong> of data in <strong>30 minutes</strong> of flight time. With many thousand flights per day, generation of data reaches up to many <strong>Petabytes</strong>.</p>

    <h1>Benefits of Big Data Processing</h1>
    <p>Ability to process Big Data brings in multiple benefits, such as-</p>
    <ul><li>usinesses can utilize outside intelligence while taking decisions</li></ul>
    <p>Access to social data from search engines and sites like facebook, twitter are enabling organizations to fine tune their business strategies.</p>
    <ul><li>Improved customer service</li></ul>
    <p>Traditional customer feedback systems are getting replaced by new systems designed with Big Data technologies. In these new systems, Big Data and natural language processing technologies are being used to read and evaluate consumer responses.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Early identification of risk to the product/services, if any</li>
        <li>Better operational efficiency</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Big Data technologies can be used for creating a staging area or landing zone for new data before identifying what data should be moved to the data warehouse. In addition, such integration of Big Data technologies and data warehouse helps an organization to offload infrequently accessed data.</p>
